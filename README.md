# Tic-Tac-Toe

A Tic Tac Toe game using console input.  

This game can be played in singleplayer or with two players.  

If played with two players, player 1 will start as `X` and player 2 will start thereafter as `O`.  

If played in singleplayer, the AI has two difficulty levels: Easy and Hard mode. Easy mode will use random numbers to determine its next move while Hard mode uses MinMax game theory to determine its next move.
